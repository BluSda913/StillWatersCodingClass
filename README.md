The students in Ms. Chia's will be in a coding class working in groups of three each working on a project to get a foundation of coding.

please click on your team name to start your project instructions.

## Team Jackson
Figure out a way for your team to make a Medium diffucult game in Scratch so others can play and enjoy.
## Team Logan
Figure out a way to build a Minecraft Clock on the Raspberry Pi.
## Team Sophie
Figure out how to use the NXT and the legos to create a domino effect that in the end can get a ping pong ball in a hole succefully.

It has to be a long chain effect so you can get full credit for the project.

You have to have at least three or more things built with NXT legos and have it programmed to help with the domino set up.
